## Project Description

DecisioNova is a multi-purpose wearable development board for use with EIT-based robotic skins. The board is designed to be smaller than available EIT electronics and operate as a stand-alone wearable device. In robotics applications, DecisioNova can act as a measurement node placed near the robotic skin patch and stream measurements to the robot controller. In prosthetic devices, DecisioNova can be incorporated into prosthesis to enable both tactile sensing and feedback.

## PlatformIO Quick Start

1. Install PlatformIO and open the repository as project.
2. To select the example you want to compile, change the value of 'default_envs' in 'platformio.ini'. You can uncomment the desired example in 'platformio' section.
3. Compile and upload the example to the board.
